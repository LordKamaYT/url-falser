# url-falser
How to make a user go to a page which isn't the one requested


## Step 1: Claim a domain

You can currently get `.zip` domains for only 15$/y at Google Domains.

## Step 2: Setup the actual bait

You can either pretend to work for an organization's support, but most of the time the most efficient way of doing this url-falser is proposing a patch to an application or game ( Example : "Adobe Premiere Crack" )

Either way, you'll provide a quick documentation on what to find inside your .zip file and how to download it from this link ( Step 3 )

# Step 3: The scam link

You'll make a scam link. To do so you can go with a domain ( I recommend mega.nz for this bait ) and then provide it to the user.
To do so :

Copy this character : `∕` 
**/!\ Beware, this is not a backslash /!\**

Make a link :
( For the purposes of this example I'll point out the unicode character which is not a backslash )
`https://mega.nz/u/file/`**∕**`@yourdomain.zip`

Make sure to replace `yourdomain.zip` with your actual domain and **keep the @ .**

You can still change the mega.nz domain, it was just for example purposes. There you go !!
